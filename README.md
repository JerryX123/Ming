## Introduction

Ling is a MoE LLM provided and open-sourced by InclusionAI. We introduce two different sizes, which are Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus. Ling-Lite has 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus has 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models demonstrate impressive performance compared to existing models in the industry.

Their structure makes it easy to scale up and down and adapt to different tasks, so users can use these models for a wide range of tasks, from processing natural language to solving complex problems. Furthermore, the open-source nature of Ling promotes collaboration and innovation within the AI community, fostering a diverse range of use cases and enhancements.

As more developers and researchers engage with the platform, we can expect rapid advancements and improvements, leading to even more sophisticated applications. This collaborative approach accelerates development and ensures that the models remain at the forefront of technology, addressing emerging challenges in various fields.
